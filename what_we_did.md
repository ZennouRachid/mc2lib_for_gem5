# Experiments Running McVersi + gem5

We use an Ubuntu Virtual machine set as follows:

Memory : 4096MB

Processor : Intel® Core™ i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20GHz × 4

Hard disk : 250 GB

OS : Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS 64-bit

## gem5 setup

- We downloaded the gem5 sources (changeset 11520) pointed to from the [McVersi webpage](https://www.marcoelver.com/research/mcversi/).

- We applied the ```mcversi_gem5.patch``` patch.

- We set up the system parameters (see below) following the paper's instructions.

- After appling the patch, we failed when trying to initialize the full systsem simulation. Thus we moved the ```mcversi.*``` files generated by the patch from the `gem5` folder to ```gem5/src/sim``` as the initialization of gem5 was not finding those files. We also copied ```mc2lib/mc2lib``` directory to the ```gem5/src/sim``` directory for the same reasons.


### Configuration Parameters

We set up the system's parameters according to Table 2 in the paper:

 - _ROB entries_: We modified the default value of ROBEntries in ```src/cpu/o3/O3CPU.py```. The default value is 192; we modify it to 40.
 
 ```ROB entries = 40``` 
 
 - _LSQ entries_: We modified the default value of LQEntries and SQEntries in ```src/cpu/o3/O3CPU.py```. Since gem5 has a separate queue for loads and stores, we set each variable to 16 so that the aggregated size becomes 32.
 
```LSQ entries = 32```
 
 - _L1 and L2 hit latency_: We modified the default value of hit_latency in the L1Cache class and L2Cache class in ```configs/common/Caches.py```. We set L1 hit latency to 3 and L2 hit latency to 30.
  
 - _Memory hit latency_: **We did not find where to set up the Memory latency parameters, so we assume we are running with the default parameters.**

# Get traces using Gem5 (github version of Gem5):

Here is an example of getting traces from Gem5 execution:


   1. Using System emulation mode (SE):
   
```./build/X86/gem5.opt --debug-flags=MMU --debug-file=mmu_trace.log ./configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --caches --l2cache -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello ```

   2. Using the full system mode (FS):

```./build/X86/gem5.opt --debug-flags=TLB --debug-file=tlb_trace.log ./configs/example/fs.py –cpu-type=TimingSimpleCPU --caches --l2cache```

## Traces of Ruby Random Memory tests:

We run the ruby random test script (configs/example/ruby_random_test.py) with the Flag MemoryAccess:

``` ./build/X86/gem5.opt --debug-flags=MemoryAccess --debug-file=ruby_random_test.trace ./configs/example/ruby_random_test.py –num-cpu=4 --caches --ruby ```

Here is an example of output:
